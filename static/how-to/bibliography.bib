 abstract = {The observations in parameter-driven models for time series of counts are generated from latent unobservable processes that characterize the correlation structure. These models result in very complex likelihoods, and even the EM algorithm, which is usually well suited for problems of this type, involves high-dimensional integration. In this article we discuss a Monte Carlo EM (MCEM) algorithm that uses a Markov chain sampling technique in the calculation of the expectation in the E step of the EM algorithm. We propose a stopping criterion for the algorithm and provide rules for selecting the appropriate Monte Carlo sample size. We show that under suitable regularity conditions, an MCEM algorithm will, with high probability, get close to a maximizer of the likelihood of the observed data. We also discuss the asymptotic efficiency of the procedure. We illustrate our Monte Carlo estimation method on a time series involving small counts: the polio incidence time series previously analyzed by Zeger.},

However, there appears to be little theory governing when Monte Carlo EM (MCEM) sequences converge. Consequently, in some applications, convergence is assumed rather than proved. Motivated by this problem in the context of modeling market penetration of new products and services over time, we develop (i) high-level conditions for rates of almost-sure convergence and convergence in distribution of any MCEM sequence and (ii) primitive conditions for almost-sure monotonicity and almost-sure convergence of an MCEM sequence when Monte Carlo integration is carried out using independent Gibbs runs. We verify the main primitive conditions for the Bass product diffusion model and apply the methodology to data on wireless telecommunication services.},

In this contribution, the almost-sure convergence of the MCEM algorithm is established. It is shown, using uniform versions of ergodic theorems for Markov chains, that MCEM converges under weak conditions on the simulation kernel. Practical illustrations are presented, using a hybrid random walk Metropolis Hastings sampler and an independence sampler. The rate of convergence is studied, showing the impact of the simulation schedule on the fluctuation of the parameter estimate at the convergence. A novel averaging procedure is then proposed to reduce the simulation variance and increase the rate of convergence.},

abstract="We propose a multiple imputation method to deal with incomplete categorical data. This method imputes the missing entries using the principal component method dedicated to categorical data: multiple correspondence analysis (MCA). The uncertainty concerning the parameters of the imputation model is reflected using a non-parametric bootstrap. Multiple imputation using MCA (MIMCA) requires estimating a small number of parameters due to the dimensionality reduction property of MCA. It allows the user to impute a large range of data sets. In particular, a high number of categories per variable, a high number of variables or a small number of individuals are not an issue for MIMCA. Through a simulation study based on real data sets, the method is assessed and compared to the reference methods (multiple imputation using the loglinear model, multiple imputation by logistic regressions) as well to the latest works on the topic (multiple imputation by random forests or by the Dirichlet process mixture of products of multinomial distributions model). The proposed method provides a good point estimate of the parameters of the analysis model considered, such as the coefficients of a main effects logistic regression model, and a reliable estimate of the variability of the estimators. In addition, MIMCA has the great advantage that it is substantially less time consuming on data sets of high dimensions than the other multiple imputation methods.",

 abstract = {The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is a powerful computational technique for locating maxima of functions. It is widely used in statistics for maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori estimation in incomplete data models. In certain situations, however, this method is not applicable because the expectation step cannot be performed in closed form. To deal with these problems, a novel method is introduced, the stochastic approximation EM (SAEM), which replaces the expectation step of the EM algorithm by one iteration of a stochastic approximation procedure. The convergence of the SAEM algorithm is established under conditions that are applicable to many practical situations. Moreover, it is proved that, under mild additional conditions, the attractive stationary points of the SAEM algorithm correspond to the local maxima of the function. presented to support our findings.},

abstract = {Abstract Multiple imputation is a popular technique for analysing incomplete data. Given the imputed data and a particular model, Rubin's rules (RR) for estimating parameters and standard errors are well established. However, there are currently no guidelines for variable selection in multiply imputed data sets. The usual practice is to perform variable selection amongst the complete cases, a simple but inefficient and potentially biased procedure. Alternatively, variable selection can be performed by repeated use of RR, which is more computationally demanding. An approximation can be obtained by a simple âstackedâ method that combines the multiply imputed data sets into one and uses a weighting scheme to account for the fraction of missing data in each covariate. We compare these and other approaches using simulations based around a trial in community psychiatry. Most methods improve on the naÃ¯ve completeâcase analysis for variable selection, but importantly the type 1 error is only preserved if selection is based on RR, which is our recommended approach.

abstract = {Summary In the practice of point prediction, it is desirable that forecasters receive a directive in the form of a statistical functional. For example, forecasters might be asked to report the mean or a quantile of their predictive distributions. When evaluating and comparing competing forecasts, it is then critical that the scoring function used for these purposes be consistent for the functional at hand, in the sense that the expected score is minimized when following the directive. We show that any scoring function that is consistent for a quantile or an expectile functional can be represented as a mixture of elementary or extremal scoring functions that form a linearly parameterized family. Scoring functions for the mean value and probability forecasts of binary events constitute important examples. The extremal scoring functions admit appealing economic interpretations of quantiles and expectiles in the context of betting and investment problems. The Choquet‐type mixture representations give rise to simple checks of whether a forecast dominates another in the sense that it is preferable under any consistent scoring function. In empirical settings it suffices to compare the average scores for only a finite number of extremal elements. Plots of the average scores with respect to the extremal scoring functions, which we call Murphy diagrams, permit detailed comparisons of the relative merits of competing forecasts.}
