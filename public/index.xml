      <description>How to handle missing values in practice ?  How to handle these missing values if we want to do estimation, inference, prediction, etc.? There doesn&#39;t exist a unique and standard answer to this question. For a straightforward application of some the most common methods we propose several workflows below, in both R and Python.

How to (R notebook)&amp;hellip; &amp;hellip; generate missing values? (PDF and related R source code) &amp;hellip; estimate with missing values?</description>

      <description>Below you will find a selection of high-quality lectures, tutorials and labs on different aspects of missing values.
   General lectures   Statistical Methods for Analysis With Missing Data
 (Marie Davidian, course at NC State University, spring 2017)
    This course provides an overview of modern statistical frameworks and methods for analysis in the presence of missing data. Both methodological developments and applications are emphasized.</description>

      <description>On this platform we attempt to give you an overview of main references on missing values. We do not claim to gather all available references on the subject but rather to offer a peak into different fields of active research on handling missing values, allowing for an introductory reading as well as a starting point for further bibliographical research. See here for a full (and uncommented) list of references.
Inspired by CRAN Task View on Missing Data and a review of Imbert &amp;amp; Vialaneix on handling missing values (2018, written in French) we organized our selection of relevant references on missing values by different topics.</description>

      <description>R Packages This page provides introductions to popular missing data packages with small examples on how to use them. Thus the page gives more extensive information than the CRAN Task View on Missing Data, which is recommended to get a first overall overview about the CRAN missing data landscape. You can also contribute on your own to this page and provide a short introduction to a missing data package. Take a look at this short description on how to do this.</description>

      <description>Here you will find a constantly growing list of interesting data sets which are frequently used in the R community working on missing values. These data sets can be useful to get familiar with different concepts in handling missing values and to assess the quality and performance of new methods.

      <description>Package: VIM
Category: Single Imputation, Visualisations for Missing Data
Use-Cases: Single imputation for numerical, categorical, ordered and semi-continous variables, Missing data visualizations
Popularity: 
Description: New tools for the visualization of missing and/or imputed values are introduced, which can be used for exploring the data and the structure of the missing and/or imputed values. Depending on this structure of the missing values, the corresponding methods may help to identify the mechanism generating the missing values and allows to explore the data including missing values.</description>

      <description>Package: missForest
Category: Single Imputation
Use-Cases: Single Imputation of continuous and/or categorical data.
Popularity: 
Description: The function &amp;lsquo;missForest&amp;rsquo; in this package is used to impute missing values particularly in the case of mixed-type data. It uses a random forest trained on the observed values of a data matrix to predict the missing values. It can be used to impute continuous and/or categorical data including complex interactions and non-linear relations.</description>
