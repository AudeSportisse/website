# CONTRIBUTING #

### Please contribute!

We love collaboration.

### Bugs?

* Submit (or solve!) an issue on the [Issues page](https://github.com/R-miss-tastic/website/issues)

### Contributions to website improvements

* Fork this repo to your Github account
* Clone your version on your account down to your machine from your account, e.g,. `git clone https://github.com/<yourgithubusername>/website.git`
* Make sure to track progress upstream (i.e., on our version of `website` at `R-miss-tastic/website`) by doing `git remote add upstream https://github.com/R-miss-tastic/website.git`. Before making changes make sure to pull changes in from upstream by doing either `git fetch upstream` then merge later or `git pull upstream` to fetch and merge in one step
* Make your changes (bonus points for making changes on a new feature branch)
* Rebuild site entirely using **R** package `blogdown` (with the line code `build_site()`). Be sure to have hugo, R and blogdown installed! More details at
[this link](https://github.com/R-miss-tastic/website/blob/master/.github/blogdown_usage.md)
* Commit and push up to your account
* Submit a pull request to home base (likely master branch, but check to make sure) at `R-miss-tastic/website`
